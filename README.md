# Ember

ðŸ”¥ **Ember** is a simple C++ web framework designed for learning and experimentation. The primary goal of this project is to understand how C++ can be used in web application development, following the structure and principles inspired by the Laravel framework.

## Features

- **HTTP Request Handling:** Classes to handle HTTP requests.
- **HTTP Response Handling:** Classes to handle HTTP responses.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Follows OOP principles similar to Laravel.
- **Google Test Integration:** Unit tests using Google Test framework.
- **CMake Build System:** Uses CMake for building the project.

## Requirements

- **C++17 or higher**
- **CMake 3.10 or higher**
- **SQLite3**
- **Google Test**

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ember.git
cd ember
```

### Build and Test the Project

You can use the `build.sh` script to clean, configure, build, and test the project.

```sh
./build.sh
```

This script will:

1. Clean up old build files.
2. Configure the project with CMake.
3. Build the project.
4. Run all tests and show the results.

### Directory Structure

- **`include/`:** Contains header files for the project.
- **`src/`:** Contains source files for the project.
- **`tests/`:** Contains test files for the project.
- **`googletest/`:** Directory for Google Test framework.
- **`build/`:** Directory where build files will be generated.
- **`cleanup.sh`:** Script to clean up build files.
- **`build.sh`:** Script to build and test the project.

## Learning Objectives

The main purpose of this project is to provide a learning platform for C++ web application development. By working on this project, you will learn:

- How to structure a C++ project for web development.
- How to use CMake for managing builds.
- How to implement HTTP request and response handling.
- How to write unit tests with Google Test.
- How to follow object-oriented design principles in C++.
